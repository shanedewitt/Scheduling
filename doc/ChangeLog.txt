Nov 2009: First commit into svn of Alpha Version of Scheduling GUI (v2.2)

V2.2
Version downgraded to 1.0 to reflect state of software.

v1.1 (released June 7 2010)
- Removed references to "View EHR" from ctxCalendarGrid and DAppointPage.

- Removed dependence of DPatientApptDisplay on Crystal Reports. 
- Added UserControl UCPatientAppts to encapsulate functionality of DPatientApptDisplay; right now it does not include printing.

- Better printing in UCPatientAppts.
- Removal of Crystal Reports
- Partial Rework of Clinic Patient List report
- Other reports that used Crystal don't work yet.
- Fixes for Strongly typed DataTables (change the RESOURCEID from uint to int) to support table merge from untyped table.

- Tiny bug fixes to fix compile errors
- Some debugging code to attach the program to the console to print messages.
- Letters:
-- Cancellation letters now work.
-- Initial work on Rebook Letters.
- Provided framework for Rebook letters; but they don't work.
- Added the appointment dates to the printed letters.
- Made more keyboard shortcuts on the main menu.
- New kids build for all above

v1.2 (released June 19 2010):

- DCheckIn.cs: Handling of providers for hospital locations (HL). If provider(s) assigned to HL linked to resource, they are brought over and if a default one is in VISTA, it's picked as the default in the combobox. If no default, combobox defaults to <None>. If resource not linked to HL, then all providers in system brought over, and combobox default is <None>.

- Updated mulitple routines and C# files - Send FM dates from VISTA rather than regular dates to support i18n (platform independent dates)
- Fix pre-existing bug in rebooking. Now it works.
- Printing from the print preview window just printed empty lists. Now fixed. (also in branch 1.2.1).
- Updated Appointment Page and routine:
- Adds the following fields in Contact Info tab:

v1.4 (released September 17 2010):
- Make combo boxes in DManagement searchable (in MS Lingo AutoComplete).
- Make sure that all DManagement lists and combo boxes are sorted.

- Fix printing of routing slip (add clinic and fix appointment time and HRN)

- DAppointPage: Now says Mobile/Cell instead of Cell Phone.
- Added a note in the DAccessTemplate to say that you have to select the right 5 or 7 day view based on what you originally saved.
- Support for checking encoding on the server (if supports UTF-8 and encoding not specified, uses UTF-8; otherwise uses what locale says).
- /e encoding start-up flag now supported.

v1.4.1 (released September 29th 2010)
- Drag and drop is fixed. It reference a non-existent cancellation reason, so it failed.
- If a patient has a Patient Cancelled appointment, scheduling the patient at the same time doesn't work anymore.
- MAKE^BSDXAPI occasionally failed. Use of Old Fileman API not successful. New Fileman API seems to work better in MAKE for filing data into patient subfile of appointment subfile of Hosp Location file.

- Appointments in Past now trigger a warning.
- Change Project file format to VS 2010.
