BSDX 2.1 for WorldVista

This is a Scheduling GUI package. I am way too tired to write complete notes right now; here are the essentials:

Pre-requisites:
FM 22
Kernel 8
XB 3 or above
SD 5.3
SD 5.3 patch 11310 (to fix a problem with the code)
BMX 2 or above

To install:
Load sd0530_11310.k
Load bsdx0210.k
There are a few compilation errors that I have to troubleshoot, but they don't seem to affect anything right now.

Post-installation tasks:
After installation, complete the following tasks to configure Windows Scheduling:
1. Using RPMS tools, assign the BSDXMENU security key. All scheduling users
must have the BSDXZMENU security key.
2. Users who are also scheduling managers must have the BSDXZMGR key
assigned. The BSDXZMGR key permits access to the Scheduling Management
menu in the client application. This menu supports the creation of clinics and
clinic groups, assignment of users to clinics, designation of user access, and other management activities. For further details, see the User Manual.
3. Make the BMXRPC and BSDXPRC menu options available to scheduling users.
These options must be somewhere in the userâ€™s path, either as a secondary option
or as members of a menu to which the user has access.
4. Use Scheduling Management to configure Resources (clinics), Users, Resource
Groups, Access Types, and Access Type Groups. See the User Manual for
detailed instructions.
